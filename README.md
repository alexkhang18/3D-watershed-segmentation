This code performs watershed segmentation of biological cell in 3D using nuclei as seed points. This code requires a nuclear stain to identify seed points and a cell stain (e.g., f-actin, CellMask) to identify the cell body. Please see the Microsoft Word documented named detailed_instructions for detailed instructions. This code was developed for the following publication:
